OVERVIEW
Predicting financial risk and pre-empting bankruptcy is a critical challenge for SMEs, with significant consequences for stakeholders and the broader economy. Traditional risk models often fail to capture nuanced patterns in financial data and overlook qualitative signals such as market sentiment. This project presents an end-to-end solution that combines:

Machine learning models for structured financial data

Sentiment analysis of financial text using FinBERT (a transformer-based NLP model)

Integration of both quantitative and qualitative data for robust risk profiling

FEATURES
Calculation of key financial risk metrics: Altman Z-score, Ohlson O-score, Zmijewski Score

Handling of severe class imbalance using SMOTE and other resampling techniques

Implementation of multiple machine learning classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, KNN

Fine-tuned sentiment analysis using FinBERT on financial news and reports

Hybrid model combining structured and unstructured data for bankruptcy prediction

Performance evaluation with metrics suitable for imbalanced data: Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC

Visualizations: Confusion matrices, ROC curves
